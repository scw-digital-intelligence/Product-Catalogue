It involves specialised clinical care or surgery, with demand generated following a referral from a GP or community health professional. Outpatient care makes up a substantial proportion of planned care activity, which can often follow on to an elective inpatient stay or further specialist treatment. Performance of planned care is measured through metrics such as, RTT (consultant led referral to treatment waiting times), 2WW (cancer care waiting times) and DM01 (diagnostic metrics), with public reporting included within the provider performance portfolio.
